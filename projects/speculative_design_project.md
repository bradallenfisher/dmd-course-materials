## Project breif
In 2009, Dr. Bruce M. Tharp and Stephanie M. Tharp published a blog post called ["The 4 Fields of Industrial Design: (No, not furniture, trans, consumer electronics, & toys)."](http://www.core77.com/posts/12232/the-4-fields-of-industrial-design-no-not-furniture-trans-consumer-electronics-toys-by-bruce-m-tharp-and-stephanie-m-tharp-12232) in an attempt to categorize design intentions. As described in a followup post published on Dec. 9, 2015, ["What is Discursive Design?,"](http://www.core77.com/posts/41991/What-is-Discursive-Design) the practice of designing for the purpose of provoking thought is known as speculative design. Works located in this category of design are often indistinguishable from art.

Design fictions are useful for referencing current issues, and yet proposing how something could be.
