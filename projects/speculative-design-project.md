# Speculative Design Project
## What is speculative design?
To discuss speculative design, we must first talk about the four kinds of design as published on the core77.com blog in 2009 by Dr. Bruce M. Tharp. The practice of designing objects for the purpose of asking critical questions is called discursive design, more popularly known as speculative design. It often finds itself blurring the lines between once distinct fields of art and design.
