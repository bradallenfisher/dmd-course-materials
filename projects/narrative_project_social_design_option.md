# Narrative Project: Social Design Option

## Brief:

Imagine a better world 50 years into the future. In this project, you will create an interactive narrative hosted on the web.

## Process

1. Discover Phase
  1. Choose three categories that seem the most interesting from the following list:
    - education
    - economy
    - health/wellness
    - transportation
    - technology
    - government
    - freedom
    - justice
    - democracy
    - business/trade
    - environment
    - food
    - energy
    - labor
  2. Now that you have selected three categories, write them across the top of a sheet of paper to form three columns. Imagine what would be an ideal situation 50 years from now for that category. Respond to each category with a short one-sentence description of this scenario. Try to have an inspiration source for your ideas, though you do not need to mention it (IE - Flying cars as shown in the film, Blade Runner). Write at least one response per category, but feel free to write down as many as you like. Limit yourself to 10 minutes. **Take a photo of your process and post it to the Studio Project feed**
2. Define
  1. Choose one of the category responses. Write the response as a short sentence, **"In 50 years, "** . An example setence would be *In 50 years, the world will restore all of the world's endangered wildlife species to healthy populations.*
3. Develop
  1. You will now use Twine to create a fictional, yet plausible narrative that describes how this imagined future you have described came to be. To clarify, shape-shifting lizard people is not a plausibility.
4. Deliver
  1. Download the Twine file and submit to the project Dropbox. Post the URL to the Studio page for your classmates to review.
