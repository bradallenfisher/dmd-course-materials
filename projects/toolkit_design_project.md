## Project brief
In this project, you will be designing a toolkit. Toolkits are developed as a means to help people put learned concepts into practice. This project will result in the development of a toolkit that includes two step; a concept teaching step and an implementation step. You will help users of your toolkit generate ideas and then put those ideas into action.

Project must contain a set of step-by-step, visual instructions specifying an approximate time it should take a person to complete each step.

### Scope
You will be creating a downloadable PDF document that anyone can print and use. Your toolkit must be feasible for a person to complete in an hour.

### Example project
[Project management toolkit](../toolkit/project_management.md) **[include same delvierables as this assignment]**
- This will also double as an included tool for helping students manage their creative projects! *Sneaky!*

### Case studies

## Learning resources
### Readings and screenings
Form design: [What Difference Does a Form Make: Redesign and Evaluation of a Form for Documenting In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/22800/Au_washington_0250E_11500.pdf?sequence=1)
