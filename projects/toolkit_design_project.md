## Brief
In this project, you will be designing a toolkit. Toolkits are developed as a means to help people put learned concepts into practice. This project will result in the development of a toolkit that includes two step; a concept teaching step and an implementation step. You will help users of your toolkit generate ideas and then put those ideas into action.

## Scope
You will be creating a PDF document that anyone can print out and use.
Your toolkit must be feasible for a person to complete in an hour.
