## Project description
In this project, you will be designing a toolkit. Toolkits are typically developed as a means to help people implement newly learned concepts. This project will result in the development of a toolkit that includes two stages; a design thinking stage and an implementation stage. You will help users of your toolkit generate ideas and then put those ideas into action.
