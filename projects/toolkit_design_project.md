## Project description
In this project, you will be designing a toolkit. Toolkits are developed as a means to help people put learned concepts into practice. This project will result in the development of a toolkit that includes two stages; a design thinking stage and an implementation stage. You will help users of your toolkit generate ideas and then put those ideas into action.
