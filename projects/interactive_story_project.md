# Interactive Story Project

## Brief
In this project, you will create an interactive story that uses empathy for helping people better understand REPLACE-WITH-ISSUE. Following the double diamond process, you will develop, design, and deliver research, ideas, and a digital story experience.

This project will serve as a basis for a followup design project, where you will design a digital service or product.
