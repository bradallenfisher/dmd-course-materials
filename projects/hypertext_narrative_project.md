## Project description
 In this project, you will be creating a hypertext narrative. You will use software called Twine to construct a non-linear speculative story that describes a time in the near future where there is a challenging issue. The goal of your story is to allow you to explore the main issue in any way that is interesting and engaging.
 
 By imagining a story that focuses on a contemporary (timely) issue based in reality while imagining possibilities outside currently technology or societal constraints, you allow yourself to develop ideas that you may not have otherwise developed. A fiction also allows the author to simultaneously explore the ethical and social implications of such possibilities. This can be useful for suggesting a way forward with regards to current problem spaces. The science fiction genre has been historically very good at this type of story telling.

## Constraints

### Inside realm of possibility
The story should remain somewhere between [possible and probable](http://sds.parsons.edu/transdesign/seminar/speculating-beyond-the-possible/), as to help readers suspend disbelief. (Every person on Earth gaining the innate ability to fly tomorrow is outside of the possible realm, whereas every person on Earth being given jet packs to fly is within the possible realm. Highly unprobable, yet possible.)

### Technical format
* Must create a twine, and upload to a specified location on github.com.


### Formal constraints
* Text must be written with English
* Pages must contain at least one hyperlink
* Must contain the following types of hyperlinks:
  - Link for performing an action. 
  - Link to a page that describes a physical space (real or imagined).
  - Link that describes a character.
  - Link that progresses you through the plot (can also be any of the other types of links).
* Assessment emphasis is not placed on styling, layout, and color. You are free to style as desired through CSS and related methods allowed in the Twine. Please ensure there is enough contrast between text, background, and links to maintain readability. All default style options are acceptable for submission.

## Steps to completion 
1. Propose at least three story concepts
2. Obtain feedback
3. Choose one concept to develop
4. Present a story proposal
  1. Map events to a plot diagram
  2. Describe characters
  3. Use foreshadowing or irony
  4. Theme revealed by end of story
5. Identify content
6. Perform research on content
7. Map out the story
8. Program the story with Twine
9. Put onto github.com
10. Publish git repo link on course website
11. Write project statement based on **statement standards**
12. Obtain feedback
13. Revise

## Concept development
### Choosing an issue
The issue, otherwise known as the theme, is the impetus for writing a story in the first place. This should be based on a topic that you are passionate about and interested in exploring.

### Deconstructing the issue
In a constructivist perspective, everything is made of smaller parts, and figuring out what those parts are can lead to moments of insight. You can figure out what the parts are by describing the subject and how it functions in more general, or abstract language.

### Contextualization
Now that you have deconstructed the issue at hand, it is time to apply the insights to plausible scenarios and expressions of possible solutions.

### Formal presentation
Form refers to shape of the idea's expression. Whether written, visual, or physically constructed, you give your audience a method for engaging with your ideas. Refer to the formal constraints of the project for details.

### Example concept development process
Theme(issue): Poverty
