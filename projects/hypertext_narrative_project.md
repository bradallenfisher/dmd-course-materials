## Project brief
 In this project, you will be creating a hypertext narrative. You will use software called Twine to construct a non-linear, speculative story that describes an event in the near future. The goal of your story is to allow you to explore the main issue in any way that is interesting and engaging.
 
 Framing a contemporary issue within the context of a fictional technological and social reality can help a designer to discover new and surprising insights. The science fiction genre does this extensively, often by showing events that result in undesired consequences, inspiring the audience into self-reflection.

## Constraints

### Inside realm of possibility
The story should remain somewhere between [possible and probable](http://sds.parsons.edu/transdesign/seminar/speculating-beyond-the-possible/), as to help readers suspend disbelief. (Every person on Earth gaining the innate ability to fly tomorrow is outside of the possible realm, whereas every person on Earth being given jet packs to fly is within the possible realm. Highly unprobable, yet possible.)

### Technical format

- **Video:** Video of a sample project being created
- Must create a twine, and upload to a specified location on github.com.


### Formal constraints
* Non-linear narrative structure (hyperlinks allow you to experience the story in a way not tied to chronological events). Viewers are allowed and encouraged to jump to different points along the plot diagram.
* Text must be written primarily in English language, but can make use of other languages.
* Pages must contain at least one hyperlink
* Must contain the following types of hyperlinks:
  - Link for performing an action. **(Example image)**
  - Link to a page that describes a physical space (real or imagined). **(Example image)**
  - Link that describes a character. **(Example image)**
  - Link that progresses you through the plot (can be any of the other types of links). **(Example image)**
* Assessment emphasis is not placed on styling, layout, and color. You are free to style as desired through CSS and related methods compatible with Twine. However, please ensure there is enough contrast between text, background, and links to maintain readability. All default style options are acceptable for submission.

## Steps to completion 
1. Propose at least three story concepts
2. Obtain feedback
3. Choose one concept to develop
4. Present a story proposal
  1. Map events to a plot diagram

  4. Theme revealed by end of story
5. Identify content
6. Perform research on content
7. Map out the story
8. Program the story with Twine
9. Put onto github.com
10. Publish git repo link on course website
11. Write project statement based on **statement standards**
