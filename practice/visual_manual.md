![Desk with symbol book](https://unsplash.it/1000/400?image=119)

From the moment we wake up, we are interacting with the designed environment. Everything in the home, place of work, and journey to and from has been designed by a person or institution. The degree of care for each designed artifact or experience can vary dramatically, giving users a range of experience from a sense delight to intense dismay. Communicating how a product or system works is not entirely straight forward, and is therefore the focus of this activity.

Communicating ideas through visual images can be difficult. Listen to this 99 Percent Invisible podcast episode called Ten Thousand Years, where designers attempt to warn future civilizations about the dangers of radioactive waste.

For this activity, you will create a visual "How To" guide that explains how to operate, perform, or otherwise understand some aspect of daily life that you once struggled to understand. It can be anything from visually explaining how to tie a knot to instructions for proper posture while sitting. The more personal to your own experiences, the better.

**Process:**
1. Select something you've struggled to understand for which you would like to create a visual how-to guide
  - Practice KISS.
1. Use a drawing tool, digital or physical to produce the visual manual.
  - Examples:  
  - Using pre-made graphics is fine. (Example: [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/)) 
  - If making drawings by hand, use a scanner for best results.
2.
