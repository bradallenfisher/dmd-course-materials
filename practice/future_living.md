# Future living

## Background
In their project, [United Micro Kingdoms (UmK): A Design Fiction](http://www.unitedmicrokingdoms.org/), Dunne and Raby explore the value systems of fictional cultures and their built environments. These societies, while invented, are framed in such a way that has the viewer trying to self categorize their own value systems.

  In this activity, you will find and propose How Might We (HMW) questions to better understand themes and opportunities for living in the future.

What are your values now?
Will they change in the future?
How do you know?

### Deliverable 2: Visual communication
Create a digital or physical collage based on your sketch from the futurecasting worksheet that communicates your HMW question. (1 hour)
