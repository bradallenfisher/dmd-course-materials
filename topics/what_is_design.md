From the moment we wake up, we are interacting with the designed environment. Everything in the home, place of work, and journey to and from has been designed by a person or institution. The degree of care for each designed artifact or experience can vary dramatically, giving users a range of experience from a sense delight to intense dismay. Communicating how a product or system works is not entirely straight forward, and is therefore the focus of this activity.
