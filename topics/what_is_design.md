From the moment we wake up, we are interacting with design. Everything in the home, place of work, and journey to and from has been influenced by a designer. The degree of care for each designed artifact or experience can vary dramatically, giving people a range of experience - from a sense delight to intense dismay. Design as a field of practice has changed considerably since the days of the Bauhaus, as people, businesses, and institutions have begun recognize the impact that the design process can have for successful and positive outcomes in solving complex and ambiguous problems.
