# Design thinking

In an ambiguous situation, you don't know what you don't know. Design thinking is a term that refers to any process by which a person attempts to understand and evaluate an adaptive problem by generating a large array of ideas and questioning underlying assumptions. There are a variety of individuals, institutions, and organizations that develop processes aimed at making difficult problems more approachable, thereby increasing the likelihood that a solution can be found. Some organizations include IDEO, Frog Design, Stanford D.School, etc.
