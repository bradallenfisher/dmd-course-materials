## Why stories?
In the talk, [The storytelling animal: Jonathan Gottschall at TEDxFurmanU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhd0XdedLpY), Jonathan Gottshcall tells about the pervasive role stories play in the human experience. Storytelling is how humans organize reality. As a designer, you are organizing reality for the people around you.

**Films, novels, drawings and paintings, comic books, and games** are products that tell a story to highlight a moral or ethical quandary, contribute to discourse on a popular or marginalized subject, function a teaching tool, entertain, illuminate, or . 

** Podcasts** often combine journalism techniques and creative sound editing to disseminate knowledge and promote empathy.

**Industrial design** use visual and sculptural elements to communicate what a product does and how it's used.

**Architecture** uses form and dimension of space and structure to tell the story of how people should use space, creating places for rest or work and all other aspects of sheltered human interaction.

**Wayfinding** is tells the story of how to find your way in an unfamiliar place, often delivered through signs, markers, lights, color, and other architectural features.
