## Why stories?
In the talk, [The storytelling animal: Jonathan Gottschall at TEDxFurmanU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhd0XdedLpY), Jonathan Gottshcall tells about the pervasive role stories play in the human experience. Storytelling is how humans organize reality. As a designer, you are organizing reality for the people around you.

## Narrative structure

A narrative structure orders or disorders the content of a story for the audience. There are commonly used frameworks for storytelling which started with Aristotle's three part structure which consisted of a beginning, middle, and end.

Hollywood films tend to have structures that traditionally sell well in the box office, increasing the probability that they will see a return on the production investment. The perception is that experimental or uncommon narrative structures tend to be risky. The same can be said for large game developers who are prone to sequels of high selling titles.

This can explain why many of the novel or boundary-pushing films tend to come from independent authors and screenwriters, indie game developers, indie filmmakers, and so on.

## Background

Gustav Freytag (1816 - 1895), a German dramatist and novelist, developed the structure for the way stories are told in ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama. This analysis is known as Freytag's analysis, dramatic structure, or Freytag's Pyramid. His analysis consisted of the following parts:

1. exposition
2. rising action
3. climax
4. falling action
5. dénouement/resolution

This structure was more descriptive of Greek and Shakespearean plays, whereas contemporary narrative structures have much greater contrast in rising and falling action.

Almost all Hollywood films, Shakespearean plays, and Greek and Roman Mythologies follow these linear structures:

- Three Act Structure
- Five Act Structure
- Journey

### Non-linear Narrative Structures:
A non-linear structure is not necessarily chronological or cause and effect based. Story is unfolded simultaneously and recursively.

### Interactive Narrative
The story-line in an interactive narrative work is not predetermined. The story is constructed based on a viewer's choices real-time. Games that use this structure often rely on sophisticated AI software to construct the environment around these choices.

#### Decision Nodes
An interactive narrative is comprised of decision or action points called nodes, where the user impacts the unfolding of the narrative by making a choice or performing an action. The choice the user makes can determine which branching narrative path is taken.

For example, let's say you are playing a hypertext narrative, and your character is a young man who sees a hooded figure shoplifting. The options to proceed include a) tell the shopkeeper, b) follow the shoplifter, or c) do nothing. Depending on your choices, the story may unfold in three completely different ways.

#### IF/THEN

Logic...

#### Critical Story Path 

A critical story path can be thought of as the shortest path possible through a series of decision nodes to complete the interactive story.

To develop the critical path:

1. All the critical story beats must be accounted for
2. Determine essential actions and decisions
3. Identify the optional narrative interactions that build around the central story
