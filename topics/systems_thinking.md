# Systems thinking
A design decision that considers the impact on an entire network of affected systems, rather than a specific part, is known as systems thinking. Systems are bounded, can be nested, overlap with other systems, are autonomous in operation, parts can be distributed or co-located, and interact with the larger environment.

If you consider that an expert in any given field is an expert on the system or systems situated in that field, then people who work across systems from different fields can be considered to be transdisciplinary. A transdisciplinarian is a multi-systems worker and takes liberty to follow the networked paths for more holistic perspectives on a problem. 


## Design field examples
Cradle-to-cradle design accounts for social, economic, and ecological systems when designing consumer products.


## Social issues [Move to it's own topic and reference]
When framing programming concepts to the way humans self-organize, you can start to gain perspective on the visible and invisible forces designing and shaping a given society.

>Caught in a treadmill of social controls, that person keeps reaching for a prize that always dissolves in his hands. In a complex society, many powerful groups are involved in socializing, sometimes to seemingly contradictory goals . . . Schools, churches, and banks try to turn us into responsible citizens willing to work hard and save . . . merchants, manufacturers, and advertisers to spend our earnings on products that will produce the most profits for them . . . gamblers, pimps, and drug dealers . . . promise rewards for easy dissipation- provided we pay. The messages are very different, but their outcome is essentially the same: they make us dependent on a social system that exploits our energies for its own purposes.
