# Narrative structure
A narrative structure orders or disorders the content of a story for the audience. There are commonly used frameworks for storytelling which started with Aristotle's three part structure which consisted of a beginning, middle, and end.

Hollywood films tend to have structures that traditionally sell well in the box office, increasing the probability that they will see a return on the production investment. The perception is that experimental or uncommon narrative structures tend to be risky. The same can be said for large game developers who are prone to sequels of high selling titles.

This can explain why many of the boundary-pushing films tend to come from independent authors and screenwriters, indie game developers, indie filmmakers, and so on.

Major considerations for the storytelling include:

1. Narrative structure
  - How is the story revealed? 
2. Content
  - What is the story about
3. Delivery Media
  -  How will you tell your story so that people can understand and experience it?

### Freytag's Analysis

Gustav Freytag (1816 - 1895), a German dramatist and novelist, developed the structure for the way stories are told in ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama. This analysis is known as Freytag's analysis, dramatic structure, or Freytag's Pyramid. His analysis consisted of dividing a play into the following parts:

1. exposition
2. rising action
3. climax
4. falling action
5. d√©nouement/resolution


### Linear Narrative:
Almost all Hollywood films, Shakespearean plays, and Greek and Roman Mythologies fall into this category.

- Three Act Structure
- Five Act Structure
- Journey

### Non-linear Narrative:
A non-linear structure is not necessarily chronological or cause and effect based. Story is unfolded simultaneously and recursively.

### Interactive Narrative
The storyline in an interactive narrative work is not predetermined. The story is constructed based on a viewer's choices real-time, and relies on sophisticated AI software to construct the environment around these choices.
