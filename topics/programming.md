# Programming
Programming essentially means an entity (the programmer) ascribes functionality and instructions (the program) to an active agent (something that can run a program). One of the most complex examples of one such system is the human brain. Though the human brain transports information more slowly than a modern computer, it can perform calculations in parallel at a scale many orders of magnitude greater than what computers can currently achieve [1]. Who or what programs the brain? DNA? Your parents? The weather outside? Scientists will be no doubt be very busy trying to understand these questions better over the coming century.

## Computer science
### Paradigms [2]
A programming language can mix paradigms despite being described as a particular type.

1. Imperative
2. Procedural
3. Declarative
4. Functional
5. Object-oriented
6. Event-driven
7. Automata-based

### Parts of a program [3]

1. Variable
  * Stores data.
  * Different programming languages store different types of data.
  * Common types of data: Character, Integer, Boolean, Array (list of other variables, String (array of characters), Floating-point number
2. Control Structures
  * Applies logical decision making to existing conditions for desired outcomes.
  * Common examples include *if statements* and *loops*
  * [AI control structures](http://www.pling.org.uk/cs/lpa.html) are very complex
3. Data Structures
  * Describes how data is stored and accessed
  * Common types
    * Linear
    * Tree
    * Hash
    * Graph
4. Syntax
  * Symbol combinations that describe the program within a particular language

## Social issues [Move to it's own topic and reference]
When framing programming concepts to the way humans self-organize, you can start to gain perspective on the visible and invisible forces designing and shaping a given society.

### Consent and choice

>Caught in a treadmill of social controls, that person keeps reaching for a prize that always dissolves in his hands. In a complex society, many powerful groups are involved in socializing, sometimes to seemingly contradictory goals . . . Schools, churches, and banks try to turn us into responsible citizens willing to work hard and save . . . merchants, manufacturers, and advertisers to spend our earnings on products that will produce the most profits for them . . . gamblers, pimps, and drug dealers . . . promise rewards for easy dissipation- provided we pay. The messages are very different, but their outcome is essentially the same: they make us dependent on a social system that exploits our energies for its own purposes.
