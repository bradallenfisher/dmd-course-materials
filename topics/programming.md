# Programming
Programming essentially means an entity (the programmer) ascribes functionality and instructions (the program) to an active agent (something that can run a program). One of the most complex examples of one such system is the human brain. Though the human brain transports information more slowly than a modern computer, it can perform calculations in parallel at a scale many orders of magnitude greater than what computers can currently achieve [1]. Who or what programs the brain? DNA? Your parents? The weather outside? Scientists will be no doubt be very busy trying to understand these questions better over the coming century.


## Types
1. Procedural
2. Object oriented


Function
Logic
Loop
If statements
Array


* Variable
  * Stores data.
  * Different programming languages store different types of data.
  * Common types of data: Character, Integer, Boolean, Array (list of other variables, String (array of characters), Floating-point number
* Control Structures
  * Applies logical decision making to existing conditions for desired outcomes.
  * Common examples include *if statements* and *loops*
  * [AI control structures](http://www.pling.org.uk/cs/lpa.html) are very complex
* Data Structures
  * Describes how data is stored for efficiency and easy access
  * Common types
    * List (a series of values)
    * Map (id number with associated value)
* Syntax
  * Symbol combinations that describe the program within a particular language
