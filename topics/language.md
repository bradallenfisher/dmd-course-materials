# Language
## Background

Language is a technology that allows people and things to communicate in a reliable and repeatable fashion. In the book, *The Axemaker's Gift*, detailed accounts are given of it's invention and use throughout history. All of modern society, for better or worse, is made possible in part by language's continued development and application.

There is no one way to discuss language because fields in science, applied science, art, and liberal arts have different ways of describing its use, application, and components. That is why this description is a combination of ideas drawn from various interpretations and applications of this technology.

## Metalanguage
Language is powerful because it allows humans and non-humans alike to liberate or oppress, create or destroy, incite or quell, enlighten or obscure. The standard parts that comprise a language can be considered to be a metalanguage; abstract concepts that construct the language in question. Many different languages can be created from a metalanguage.

When teaching or communicating a new idea, the structure and parts of the metalanguage are often a major point of discussion. Understanding metalanguage often enables one to obtain mastery. It offers the answer to "why?" that many seek during the learning process.

### Examples:
**To describe speech within the English language, you need to understand the following metalanguage parts:**
* Noun
* Pronoun
* Verb
* Adjective
* Adverb
* Preposition
* Conjunction
* Interjection

## Sub-language
In addition to metalanguage, you can also have sublanguage, or a nuanced use of existing language that allows for more diverse or clear meaning to be created. When different sublanguages have shared expressions, the meaning being communicated can become confused. This is why when two people who study in two different fields use the same word to describe something, there is an increased chance for miscommunication. Either those two people must work to understand each other's uncommon use of the language, or they require an interpreter who is versed in both sublanguages.

Designers are now expected to be well versed in many languages and sub languages, and have the ability to quickly learn them by figuring out the metalanguage.
