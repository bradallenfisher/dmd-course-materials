# Measuring success

   To measure success, we must have a common understanding about what we mean by success and what we mean by measurement. Some key aspects of success are not teachable, measurable, or relevant for everyone. Determining measurement metrics is also no small ordeal, as there would first need to be a universally agreed upon notion of success.
   In higher education, there is a grade point average (GPA), which is a measurement only in one's ability to perform well in an institution of learning. There is no GPA for your life. It is possible that there is correlation between GPA and success post graduation, but a high GPA does not guarantee a person will get a job, well-roundedness, or proper preparation for the unexpected challenges ahead. Design, as in life, is a constant struggle against certain forces be they economic, cultural, familial, etc. A successful person then may be defined as one who can overcome whatever forces may be in opposition to achieve a desired outcome.
   If you are given an assignment in class, you are graded on your ability to overcome one of the most powerful forces facing the planet, ignorance.
   I am highlighting what I believe are the metrics of success that cannot necessarily be measured easily.

 You will have a keen awareness of your capabilities, both shortcomings and strengths.
