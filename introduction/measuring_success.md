# Measuring success

To measure success, we must have a common understanding about what we mean by success and what we mean by measurement. Some key aspects of success are not teachable, measurable, or relevant for everyone. Determining measurement metrics is also no small ordeal, as there would first need to be a universally agreed upon notion of success.

In many educational institutions, the grade point average (GPA) measures a student's ability to meet the success metrics as set by an instructor or governing assessment entity. It is possible that there is correlation between GPA and success post graduation, but a high GPA does not guarantee a person will get a job, become well-rounded, or be prepared for the unexpected challenges ahead. Design is a constant struggle against ignorance and the forces underlying poor decisions. In this program, a successful students will require the following:
 
 1. Adaptability
   - shift mental models to approach problems differently
   - rapidly identify and learn required knowledge 
 2. Understanding
   - explore multiple perspectives
   - deconstruct
   - contextualize
 3. Focus
   - prioritize essential tasks
   - awareness of capabilities
 4. Perseverance
   - iterate to the best result within constraints
   - apply time an energy
