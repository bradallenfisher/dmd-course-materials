# Measuring success

To measure success, we must have a common understanding about what we mean by success and what we mean by measurement. Some key aspects of success are not teachable, measurable, or relevant for everyone. Determining measurement metrics is also no small ordeal, as there would first need to be a universally agreed upon notion of success.

In higher education, there is a grade point average (GPA), which is a measurement only in one's ability to perform well in an institution of learning. There is no GPA for your life. It is possible that there is correlation between GPA and success post graduation, but a high GPA does not guarantee a person will get a job, become well-rounded, or be prepared for the unexpected challenges ahead. Design, as in life, is a constant struggle against certain forces be they economic, cultural, familial, professional, etc. A successful person then may be defined as one who can overcome whatever forces may be in opposition to achieve a desired outcome. After getting knocked down, this person can persevere, and eventually rebound. This trait is known as being "resilient." 

If you are given an assignment in class, you are graded on your ability to overcome one of the most powerful forces facing the planet â€“ ignorance. Overcoming this force requires that you dedicate time and energy to a task while maintaining the curiosity that motives real learning. A successful person will spend far more time and energy on a problem space and have the curiosity and drive to persevere. To do this efficiently, focus is required.


I am highlighting what I believe are key metrics of success for a resilient person.
 
 1. adaptability
 2. understanding
 3. focus
 4. perseverance
 
You will have a keen awareness of your capabilities, both shortcomings and strengths.
